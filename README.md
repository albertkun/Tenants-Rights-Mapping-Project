# Tenants-Rights-Mapping-Project
* This is the project of Ray Hsiao, Brian Zamora, and Sam Karakas for Asian American Studies 191A.
* We will be developing, throughout the semester, a community-based mapping project emphazing tenants' rights and language justice in Los Angeles. Our aim is to make a survey to collect, analyze, and visualize tenants' rights issues in LA happening right now. We hope to make the survey editable by the community to generate versions in as many of the many languages spoken as possible to promote greater visibility for marginalized communities in the area, and of tenants' rights abuses and issues generally. We will be reaching out to the Los Angeles Tenants Union as our goals closely align with theirs--to share information about the issues faced by renters and make more visible the role of landlords are producers of gentrification.
* One of the most important issues we will face both technically and ethically is the protection of user privacy. We want the information to be geographically specific but without making the users targets for retaliation. In order to achieve this we will have to decide exactly what information is necessary, what should be visualized, and how to make the data secure.
